###  **Background** 

The project visualizes China railway data from 2014-2022 in electronic map using Angualr, Echarts, turf.js, Mapbox.js and other third-party libraries.
It contains 4 parts, including file management, buffer analysis, railway change visualization and railway change influencing-factors. Besides, it also offers some basic map functions.
